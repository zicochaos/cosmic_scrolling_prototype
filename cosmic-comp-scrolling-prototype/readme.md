# COSMIC scrolling test session

This repository can install an additional greeter entry named **COSMIC
Scrolling Test**. It runs the compositor built in this clone — normally
`target/debug/cosmic-comp`, or `target/fastdebug/cosmic-comp` when the parent
suite recorded `SCROLLING_PROFILE=fastdebug` in `.cosmic-scrolling/manifest` —
with `COSMIC_SCROLLING_TILING=1`. The normal COSMIC session and
`/usr/bin/cosmic-comp` are not replaced. Its COSMIC configuration is isolated
in `target/scrolling-test-config`, or in `.cosmic-scrolling/session-config`
when the parent suite is installed (keeping the settings safe from
`cargo clean`), so it does not change your normal COSMIC
session. When the parent suite's `install.sh` has built the modified applet,
this launcher also uses its owned `.cosmic-scrolling/prefix` for the Window
Layout applet and icons. Without that optional installation, it uses system
applets; use the CLI below to select Classic or Scrolling. For the complete
compositor + applet installation, follow the [parent README](../README.md).

No repository path is hardcoded. The installer creates
`/usr/local/bin/cosmic-scrolling-test-session` as a symlink to this clone's
launcher. The launcher resolves that symlink to find the clone. If the clone is
moved, rerun the installer from its new location.

## Build dependencies

Install the native libraries this compositor links against (from
`debian/control`):

```bash
sudo apt install \
    cmake \
    libegl1-mesa-dev \
    libfontconfig-dev \
    libgbm-dev \
    libinput-dev \
    libpixman-1-dev \
    libseat-dev \
    libsystemd-dev \
    libudev-dev \
    libwayland-dev \
    libxcb1-dev \
    libxkbcommon-dev \
    libdisplay-info-dev
```

You also need a Rust toolchain new enough for `rust-version = "1.93"`
(`Cargo.toml`) and the 2024 edition. Debian/Ubuntu's packaged `rustc`/`cargo`
are normally far too old for this; install a current toolchain with
[rustup](https://rustup.rs) instead:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Build and install

```bash
# Run from the root of your cosmic-comp clone.
cargo test --locked scrolling::tests
cargo build --locked
chmod +x start-scrolling-session.sh install-scrolling-session.sh
./install-scrolling-session.sh
```

Building only creates `target/debug/cosmic-comp`; it does not install a login
session. The installer adds the stable launcher symlink and the greeter entry.
It may request administrator authentication. It refuses to overwrite an
unrecognized session entry or launcher at the test session's paths.

To test the installer without changing the live greeter:

```bash
./install-scrolling-session.sh --destdir /tmp/cosmic-session-stage
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

`DESTDIR=/absolute/staging/path` is also supported. A staged desktop file keeps
its final `/usr/local/bin/` command; staging alone does not install a usable
login entry.

After later code changes, only `cargo build --locked` is required. Reinstall
only after moving the clone or changing the session files.

## Start the session

Do not invoke `start-scrolling-session.sh` inside a running desktop: it launches
a full COSMIC session and now rejects that usage. Use the greeter:

1. Save your work and log out of the current desktop session.
2. Open the session chooser on the login screen.
3. Select **COSMIC Scrolling Test**.
4. Log in normally.

The test session uses the physical keyboard directly, so the outer desktop
cannot intercept `Super` shortcuts. Open four terminals with `Super+T`, then
test:

```text
Super+Left / Super+Right
Super+Shift+Left / Super+Shift+Right
Super+Ctrl+Up / Super+Ctrl+Down
```

Do not set `COSMIC_BACKEND=winit` for this login session. Automatic backend
selection uses the normal KMS backend.

## Switch tiling mode from the CLI

Run these commands from a terminal inside **COSMIC Scrolling Test**. The test
launcher sets `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to this clone's isolated configuration, so the
commands do not modify the normal COSMIC session.

Switch immediately to Scrolling mode:

```bash
MODE_FILE="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cosmic/com.system76.CosmicComp/v1/tiling_engine"
printf '%s\n' Scrolling >"$MODE_FILE"
```

Switch immediately to Classic mode:

```bash
MODE_FILE="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cosmic/com.system76.CosmicComp/v1/tiling_engine"
printf '%s\n' Classic >"$MODE_FILE"
```

For repeated testing, define a helper once in that terminal:

```bash
MODE_FILE="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cosmic/com.system76.CosmicComp/v1/tiling_engine"
set_tiling_mode() {
    case "$1" in
        Classic|Scrolling) printf '%s\n' "$1" >"$MODE_FILE" ;;
        *) printf 'Usage: set_tiling_mode Classic|Scrolling\n' >&2; return 2 ;;
    esac
}
```

Then use:

```bash
set_tiling_mode Scrolling
set_tiling_mode Classic
```

Values are case-sensitive and must be exactly `Classic` or `Scrolling`. The
running compositor watches this setting, so logging out or restarting it is not
required. Check the active configured value with `cat "$MODE_FILE"`.

## Remove the test session

First log into the normal COSMIC session. Then run:

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/share/wayland-sessions/cosmic-scrolling-test.desktop
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/cosmic-scrolling-test-session
```

That removes the greeter entry. The normal
`/usr/share/wayland-sessions/cosmic.desktop` entry is not touched.

Remove settings created by the test session:

```bash
# Run from the root of the clone used for testing.
rm -rf target/scrolling-test-config
```

When the parent suite's installer is present, the isolated settings live in
`.cosmic-scrolling/session-config` instead; remove them with the parent
`./uninstall.sh --purge-config`.

To remove build output produced while testing:

```bash
# Run from the root of the clone used for testing.
cargo clean
```

`cargo clean` deletes the entire repository `target/` directory, including
unrelated cached build artifacts. It is optional and can require a full rebuild
next time.

## Check for leftovers

Verify that the greeter entry is gone:

```bash
test ! -e /usr/share/wayland-sessions/cosmic-scrolling-test.desktop \
  && echo "Test session entry removed"
test ! -e /usr/local/bin/cosmic-scrolling-test-session \
  && echo "Test session launcher removed"
```

Check for stale sockets left by previous nested/Winit tests:

```bash
find "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type s -name 'wayland-*' -print
find /tmp/.X11-unix -maxdepth 1 -type s -name 'X*' -print 2>/dev/null
```

Do not delete sockets that have a live compositor or X server attached. The
dedicated login session normally cleans up its sockets automatically during
logout.

## Recovery

If the test session fails to start, return to the greeter and choose the normal
**COSMIC** session. If necessary, switch to a text console with
`Ctrl+Alt+F3`, log in, and remove the entry:

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/share/wayland-sessions/cosmic-scrolling-test.desktop
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/cosmic-scrolling-test-session
```
